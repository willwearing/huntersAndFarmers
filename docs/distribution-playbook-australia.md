# Hunters & Farmers — Distribution Playbook (Australia)

## Purpose
Build a practical outreach list of **Australian companies that are actively hiring sales roles right now**, then prioritise those most likely to need recruiter support.

## Constraints
- Keep it lightweight and repeatable
- Use no paid tools
- Use no external API keys

## Free Data Sources
- LinkedIn Jobs (manual search)
- Seek
- Indeed
- Company careers pages
- Google search operators (e.g. `site:company.com careers sales manager australia`)
- LinkedIn company pages and employee profiles

## Outreach List-Building Criteria
Only add companies that match at least **2 of 4** criteria below:

1. **Active role signal**
   - At least one sales/revenue job ad currently live in Australia
   - Prefer ads posted in the last 21 days

2. **Role relevance signal**
   - Hiring role types we place (SDR/BDR, AE, AM, BDM, Sales Manager, Head of Sales, RevOps)

3. **Hiring urgency signal**
   - Multiple sales roles open at once, or repeat postings for the same role

4. **Growth context signal**
   - New market expansion, product launch, recent growth announcements, or team scaling language

## Minimum Fields Per Account (in sheet/CRM)
- Company name
- Website
- Industry
- HQ / hiring city
- Role title(s)
- Job URL(s)
- Posted date (if visible)
- Hiring manager or likely decision maker (name + title)
- Source platform (LinkedIn/Seek/Indeed/Careers page)
- Recruiter usage signal (Yes / No / Unclear)
- Priority score

## Recruiter Usage Signals (How to Check)
Use these checks before outreach messaging:

### High-confidence signals
- Job ad posted by a known recruitment agency
- Job ad explicitly says agency submissions are accepted
- Same company has multiple ads written by different external recruiters

### Medium-confidence signals
- Internal Talent Acquisition team is small but role volume is high
- Repeated reposting of critical sales roles over several weeks
- Hiring manager posts publicly asking for referrals and external help

### Negative signal
- Job ad clearly states “No agencies” or “No recruiter calls”

> Mark each account as: **Likely uses recruiters / Unclear / Likely in-house only**

## Prioritisation Model (0–10)
- Live sales ad posted recently (0–3)
- Volume of open commercial roles (0–2)
- Role seniority/business impact (0–2)
- Recruiter usage likelihood (0–2)
- Clear decision-maker identified (0–1)

Prioritise outreach for accounts scoring **7+**.

## Outreach Angle
Lead with the specific role and market context:
- Mention the exact role(s) they are advertising
- Offer a short hiring brief call
- Position around speed, quality, and role-fit

Primary CTA: **Book a call**

## Weekly Operating Cadence
1. Refresh target list from free job sources
2. Re-score active accounts
3. Remove stale postings (older than 45 days with no updates)
4. Add new decision makers where missing
5. Review reply-to-call conversion by role type and city
