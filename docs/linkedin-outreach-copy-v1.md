## Personalization variables
- {{first_name}}
- {{company}}
- {{role_title}}
- {{city_or_region}}
- {{trigger}} (e.g., "saw you’re hiring 2 AEs")

## Touch 1 — Connection request note (short)
Hey {{first_name}}, saw {{company}} is hiring for {{role_title}}. I run Hunters & Farmers and help AU teams hire strong sales talent quickly. Keen to connect.

## Touch 2 — First DM after connect
Thanks for connecting {{first_name}}.

Noticed {{trigger}}. If useful, I can share how we’d run a tight brief + shortlist process for that role in AU (without wasting your team’s interview time).

Open to a quick 15–20 min hiring brief call?

## Touch 3 — Value follow-up (2-3 days later)
Quick one — when these roles drag, it’s usually one of 3 things:
1) scorecard is fuzzy
2) sourcing is broad but low-fit
3) interview process is too subjective

If helpful I can send a 1-page scorecard template we use for {{role_title}} hiring in Australia.

## Touch 4 — Light proof / process message
To keep this practical, our process is:
- brief + must-have criteria
- targeted shortlist
- structured evaluation

Goal is simple: better signal, less interview noise, faster fill.

If timing is bad, no stress — happy to send the scorecard template anyway.

## Touch 5 — Breakup message
I’ll close this out for now so I’m not spamming your inbox.

If {{company}} needs help on sales hiring later, just ping me and I’ll jump in.

Either way, good luck with the hiring push.

## Optional comment on their hiring post
